but wht if i just make a file that is not what the file says it is
like a c# file without c# code haha


if this then that, how is that this if that is that and this is this?
im confusing myself

using this and this using that.

else why we live, never will i understand.

for every i, increase the definition by 1, so that the i will be assigned to itself without it's old self colliding.
as for what i may do, is still unknown, but the new unknown is the greatest test of them all.


HOW ABUOT I MAKE A NEW ARGUMENT TO YOUR ARGUMENT IN ARGUING THIS ARGUMENT
